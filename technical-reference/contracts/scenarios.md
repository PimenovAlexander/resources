## Scenarios

### Deploy/Init Pool

Pool deployment is triggered by administrator of the AMM (also he is  the administrator of the router contract - `router::admin_address`). Pool deployment leads to the processing of the POOLV3\_INIT operation inside pool contract.

This operation is used both - during the initial deployment of the pool and it pool administrator wants to change some crucial parameters. Pool deployment consists of two stages&#x20;

I. Forming and sending state\_init data that holds

* Router address
* Jetton0/Jetton1 wallet addresses (these are attached to the router)
* Account contract code
* Position NFT contract code

Next newly created pool would only accept init message from the router and admin(which is set to BLACK\_HOLE\_ADDRESS in state\_init). No operations (except for [POOLV3\_INIT](pool.md#poolv3\_init)) would be processed while admin is BLACK\_HOLE\_ADDRESS.

This ensures that only thing that could activate pool is the init operation sent by the pool

II. state\_init message holds as a body [POOLV3\_INIT](pool.md#poolv3\_init) operation

This message will be accepted and sets all the data that is needed for pool operation, including optional flag that would activate the pool and make it available for mints and swaps
