## Scenarios

### Deploy/Init Pool

Pool deployment is triggered by administrator of the AMM (also he is the administrator of the router contract - `router::admin_address`) by the invoking of the operation [CREATE\_POOL](router.md#routerv3\_create\_pool). Pool deployment leads to the processing of the [POOLV3\_INIT](pool.md#poolv3\_init) operation inside pool contract. This operation is used both - during the initial deployment of the pool and it pool administrator wants to change some crucial parameters. Pool deployment consists of two stages

I. Forming and sending state\_init data that holds

* Router address
* Jetton0/Jetton1 wallet addresses (these are attached to the router)
* Account contract code
* Position NFT contract code

Next newly created pool would only accept init message from the router and admin(which is set to BLACK\_HOLE\_ADDRESS in state\_init). No operations (except for [POOLV3\_INIT](pool.md#poolv3\_init)) would be processed while admin is BLACK\_HOLE\_ADDRESS.

This ensures that only thing that could activate pool is the init operation sent by the pool

II. state\_init message holds as a body [POOLV3\_INIT](pool.md#poolv3\_init) operation

This message will be accepted and sets all the data that is needed for pool operation, including optional flag that would activate the pool and make it available for mints and swaps

### Mint

Position minting is done by sending two jettons to the router. Generally user calls [pool::getMintEstimate](pool.md#getmintestimate) to estimate the amount of the jettons that he/she need to send to mint particular amount of the liquidity in the given price range (tick range). Optionally user may send more jettons then needed to account for possible slippage.

While sending both jettons to router wallets, user sends the payload that contains the position parameters. On receiving the jettons (operation [JETTON\_TRANSFER\_NOTIFICATION](router.md#routerv3\_transfer\_notification) ) router would compute the pool address and forward the operation to the pool ([POOLV3\_FUND\_ACCOUNT](pool.md#poolv3\_fund\_account))

### Swap

Generally user calls [pool::getSwapEstimate](pool.md#getswapestimate) to estimate the amount of the jettons that he/she need to send to swap&#x20;
